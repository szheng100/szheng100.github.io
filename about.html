    <h3 class="headers">Personality Type: ISFP-T</h3>
    <p class="text"><em>Turbulent Adventurer</em></p>
    <p class="text">"An Adventurer (ISFP) is a person with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials."</p>
    <p class="text">I agree with the website's description of my personality type. I am definitely an Introverted person--more reserved and solitary--as I tend to keep to myself or people I already know. I also agree that I am Observant--approaching information from a practical perspective. I am prone to Feeling, as I'm very in touch with my emotions and often listen to my heart over my head. Finally, I am Prospecting: flexible with unexpected challenges, but more reactive than controlling of my environment.</p>
