        <div class="col_5"><h3 class="header">Why are you taking CSP?</h3>
            <p class="text">I decided to enroll in Computer Science Principles to gauge my interest in this field. And guess what? <strong>I like it!</strong> My goal is to pursue a degree--and eventually, a career--in computer science. <br>However, the current state of the world scares me, and I'm worried the job market is going to be trash :)</p>

        <div class="col_5"><h3 class="header">What are you hoping to learn by the end of the class?</h3>
            <p class="text">I'm hoping to learn about many different aspects of computer science so I can figure out what aspect of computer science I would like to pursue in the future. I am excited to learn Python, as I've always wanted to know how to code! It will help me learn how to approach learning new programming languages.</p>

    <h3 class="header">Future Plans</h3>
    <p class="text">
        After graduating high school, I plan to <strong>attend college</strong>. I'm still deciding on a college, but I'm pretty set on a <strong>computer sciene degree</strong>. Honestly, not sure what else I'd do. Hopefully, after college graduation, I'll land a great, decent-paying job. I'd love to <strong>adopt animals</strong> in the future--maybe even buy a snake--as my parents never let me have pets. Beyond that, I also want to <strong>travel and see the world</strong>.
