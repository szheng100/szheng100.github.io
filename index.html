    <h1><em>All About Selina</em></h1>
    <p><strong><em>Welcome to my website!</em></strong> This is my digital profolio, where you can learn more about <strong>ME</strong> and view all of my computer science accomplishments!<br>
    I decided to enroll in Computer Science Principles to gauge my interest in this field. And guess what? <strong>I like it!</strong> My goal is to pursue a degree--and eventually, a career--in computer science. </p>
    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <p>I'm not sure what I want my homepage to say yet, so for now, here are some random facts about me.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My favorite food is pasta.</li>
        <li>I have twin sisters.</li>
        <li>I play the flute.</li>
        <li>I was born with only 2 wisdom teeth.</li>
        <li>I'm getting into gaming with the Nintendo Switch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>
        After graduating high school, I plan to <strong>attend college</strong>. I'm still deciding on a college, but I'm pretty set on a <strong>computer sciene degree</strong>. Hopefully, after college graduation, I'll land a great, decent-paying job. I'd love to <strong>adopt animals</strong> in the future--maybe even buy a snake--as my parents never let me have pets. Beyond that, I'd love to <strong>travel and see the world</strong>.
    </p>
